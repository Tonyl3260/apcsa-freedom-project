This week was the final week for me to decide what tool I need to lockin with for my **Freedom Project**. The first tool I was deciding to lock myself into was **Javascript** since I already have some experience with it. Since I use discord weekly I decided that I could make a *Discord bot* for my server that could have any functions I would ever need. However, after talking with Mr. Mueller about what I want to do in the future, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to pursuit **Javascript** (future with game design) or **Python** (future in data analysis). Over the weekend I considered both options and research what project I could make with data analysis. At first, I thought I could make a program that recorded *bitcoin prices* or *stock price* over time and notify me when the prices drop. However, after considering both choices I don’t think I would have a use for this program myself because I don’t plan on investing in bitcoin or stocks anytime soon. I think I am going to stick with my guts and choose **Javascript** as the tool I will learn for my **Freedom Project** because I would be able to use the *Discord bot* immediately after making it. 

P.s. There is an **80% chance** of me sticking to **Javascript** and a **20% chance** of me swapping to **Python** as of right now.
