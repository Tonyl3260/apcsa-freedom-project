My name is Tony and I am a senior at High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology.
This year for my APCSA final project I have to make a project where I learn a new coding language and make something useful with it. This project is called the Freedom project. Currently, I have decided to learn javascript so I can make a bot. I am still uncertain about what type of bot I should make but first I should learn more javascript. In addition, I have already found many guides online on how to make certain bots already. During the next Freedom Friday, I should spend more time learning javascript and then deciding what to make with it.
