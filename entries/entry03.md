# Entry 3
##### 1/5/20

This week for **freedom project** I still havenâ€™t code much because I just finished gathering information on what software I need to **download**. A website that I was looking over was one from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/javascript/bot-builder-javascript-quickstart?view=azure-bot-service-4.0">microsoft</a> introduced me to stuff I would need to make a bot in general. Later this week I had to look at other people code for their discord bot to understand how it works a little better. One GitHub project I looked at was on a <a href="https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot">music bot</a>. This week I have finished setting up most of the things I need to make the discord bot so for the following weeks I just have to start **tinkering** with the code and **incorporating** more stuff to make a better bot.
